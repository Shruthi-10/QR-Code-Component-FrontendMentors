## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Building this project helped me practice flexbox. It also shed light on the difference betweeen px, em and rem. 

### Continued development

I want to focus on building Mobile first and learn and practise more of media queries. 

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/m) - This helped me understand flexbox.
